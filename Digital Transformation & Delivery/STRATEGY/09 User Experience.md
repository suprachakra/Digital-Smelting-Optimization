### **User Experience**

#### Interface & Dashboard Design
- **Operator-Focused Dashboards**: Clear, minimal-latency displays of voltage/current, temperature, anode events, and real-time PDE outputs.  
- **Manager-Level Views**: High-level KPIs (energy usage, GHG metrics), cost savings, and alerts.  
- **Responsive & Accessible**: Ensures optimal viewing on tablets or control-room monitors, with color palettes suitable for color-blind accessibility.

#### Workflow & Interaction Flows
- **Seamless Setup**: Onboarding screens for new sensor streams, PDE configurations, or optimization constraints.  
- **Alerting & Acknowledgment**: Quick visual cues for threshold breaches, with one-click escalation or override.  
- **Consistency & Simplicity**: Unified brand styling, minimal clutter, logical grouping of metrics.

#### Adoption & Training
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Embedded help clarifies PDE variables or optimization parameters.  
- **Role-Based Guidance**: Operators, managers, and R&D engineers see only relevant data or configuration options, ensuring an **intuitive** user journey.

### 5 Mentorship & Product Management Community of Practice (CoP)

To ensure **continuous improvement** and **knowledge sharing**:

A **Community of Practice (CoP)** ensures **institutional knowledge**, fosters **collaboration**, and drives **consistency** in applying SAFe and product management best practices across teams.

#### 5.1 CoP Charter & Goals

1. **Charter**:  
   - Define standards and best practices for product management, backlog refinement, SAFe ceremonies, and agile metrics.  
   - Encourage cross-team learning, especially for PDE modeling, optimization strategies, and agile scaling.

2. **Goals**:  
   - **Knowledge Sharing**: Provide a platform for open discussions on challenges and solutions.  
   - **Consistency**: Standardize on user story formats, acceptance criteria, definition of done, etc.  
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review what worked, what didn’t, and propose improvements for the next PI.

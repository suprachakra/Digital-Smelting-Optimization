#### Actors & Their Interactions
- **Plant Manager**: Accesses dashboards (UC-04) for operational insights and sets threshold alerts.  
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Collects raw sensor data, cleanses, and stores for PDE modeling.  
- **PDE Models**: Compute temperature, mass transfer, electrochemical kinetics.  
- **Optimization Engine**: Receives PDE outputs and constraints to provide real-time setpoints.  
- **SCADA Integration**: Feeds those setpoints directly to the production line, enabling (semi-)automated control.  
- **Digital Twin & ML**: Mirrors real processes, runs anomaly detection, predictive maintenance strategies.

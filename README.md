# Digital-Smelting-Optimization
A Data driven approach to Energy Efficiency and Process Enhancement

## MetalX Smelting Optimization: A Digital Transformation Project

### Project Vision
This repository showcases an Industry 4.0 approach to optimizing MetalX smelting  operations at Da Metalworks Inc. 
By leveraging PDE-based modeling, big data, and advanced optimization, we aim to reduce energy costs by up to 15% while improving sustainability.

### Key Highlights
- **Data Pipeline**: Scalable ingestion & cleaning of smelting parameters
- **PDE Modeling**: Thermal, mass transfer, and electrochemical equations
- **Optimization**: Multi-objective approach to minimize energy & emissions
- **Agile & SAFe**: Iterative release of new features per Program Increment
- **Community of Practice**: Regular knowledge-sharing & mentorship

### Repository Structure
- **data/**: Raw & cleaned datasets
- **models/**: Python scripts for PDE solutions
- **optimization/**: Scripts for objective functions, constraints, and solvers
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with detailed walkthroughs
- **reports/**: In-depth documentation and technical references
- **tests/**: Automated tests ensuring correctness & stability

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/username/metalx-smelting-optimization.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run Notebooks**: Explore `notebooks/` for data exploration and PDE modeling
4. **Optimization**: To run an optimization scenario, navigate to `optimization/` and execute
